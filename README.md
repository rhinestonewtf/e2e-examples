# Rhinestone Global Wallet Examples

This repository contains example implementations demonstrating Rhinestone's global wallet functionality with different wallet connection providers. Each example showcases how users can deposit tokens on any supported chain and spend them seamlessly on any other supported chain using a single account address.

## Examples

- **`dynamic/`** - Integration with Dynamic wallet connection
- **`privy/`** - Integration with Privy authentication and embedded wallets
- **`reown/`** - Integration with Reown (formerly WalletConnect) AppKit
- **`backend/`** - CLI bundle generator for testing Rhinestone Orchestrator intents
- **`para-viem/`** - Integration with Para using para viem sdk
- **`para-wagmi/`** - Integration with Para using para wagmi sdk

Each frontend example is a complete Next.js application demonstrating cross-chain token management powered by the Rhinestone SDK. The backend provides a CLI tool for generating and testing transaction bundles.
